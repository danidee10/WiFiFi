# WiFiFi
WiFiFi is an interactive python program to turn your Windows PC (Win 7, Win 8, Win 8.1) into a mobile hotspot, so you can share your wired internet connections to other devices or play multi-player games like Call of Duty.

*Windows 10 has GUI Support for Hotspot mode, but you can still use WiFiFi*

Internally, WiFiFi uses windows Network shell (Netsh).

##
You can start WiFiFi with

```python
python main.py
```

It'll ask you a set of questions (Network name, password etc) that would be used to configure your new hotspot.
